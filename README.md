# NYCryptoAI

Cryptocurrency and web3 have always been known for their complicated nature and nicheness. However, with the recent rise of interest from retail investors it's only right that we crypto and web3 builders create tools and applications to accomodate their level of knowledge or lack there of, that is why at NYCrypto we've been throwing around the idea of building an agentic wallet that gives users the ability to perform onchain tasks using simple human language.

Thankfully, with the launch of the Solana AI Hackathon I (Michael, lead engineer) decided to give it a try and build a lightweight MVP of what an app like this would look like in the future. Imagine the possibilities and how seamless the onboarding process would be if creating a wallet and interacting with the blockchain was as easy as talking to ChatGPT (the app with the fastest user base growth of all time). With apps like this onboarding the next billion web3 users wouldn't just be a dream or marketing speak that founders add to their pitch deck but an actual reality.
